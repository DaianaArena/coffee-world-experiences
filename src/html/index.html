        <p>
        Coffee It’s the second most consumed beverage after tea (third if you count water, but that’s not really fair), and nearly every country has its own way of preparing and drinking it. Even small towns have a place or two that sells $4 cups these days. And while coffee knowledge has percolated down from the most serious coffee fans to the average Joe looking for a cup of Joe, especially in the top coffee cities, there are some coffee-related activities that take things to another level.

            <h2>I orchestrate my mornings to the tune of coffee.</h2>
            <p>Scientists have known for many years that coffee stimulates the release of the neurotransmitter dopamine. Dopamine produces the euphoria and pleasant feelings that people often associate with their first cup of coffee in the morning.</p>
